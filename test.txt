To solve this problem, we can use a hashmap to store the indices of each element as we iterate over the array. For each element in the array, we check if the complement (target - current element) exists in the hashmap. If it does, we have found the two numbers that add up to the target. We can then return their corresponding indices.

Here is the Python code to solve the problem:

```python
def twoSum(nums, target):
    num_indices = {}
    
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in num_indices:
            return [num_indices[complement], i]
        
        num_indices[num] = i
    
    return []
```

This code has a time complexity of O(n) where n is the number of elements in the array. The space complexity is also O(n) to store the hashmap.

As for generating input values that match the function signatures [{ } { }], you can use JSON format to represent the input values. Here is an example:

```json
{
  "nums": [2, 7, 11, 15],
  "target": 9
}
```

This JSON input represents an array of integers and a target integer that can be parsed and used as input for the `twoSum` function.
[{[2,4,3], [5,6,4]}, {[0], [0]}, {[9,9,9,9,9,9,9], [9,9,9,9]}]
