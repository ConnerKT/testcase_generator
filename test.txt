To solve this problem, we can use a hashmap to store the indices of each element as we iterate over the array. For each element in the array, we check if the complement (target - current element) exists in the hashmap. If it does, we have found the two numbers that add up to the target. We can then return their corresponding indices.

Here is the Python code to solve the problem:

```python
def twoSum(nums, target):
    num_indices = {}
    
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in num_indices:
            return [num_indices[complement], i]
        
        num_indices[num] = i
    
    return []
```

This code has a time complexity of O(n) where n is the number of elements in the array. The space complexity is also O(n) to store the hashmap.

As for generating input values that match the function signatures [{ } { }], you can use JSON format to represent the input values. Here is an example:

```json
{
  "nums": [2, 7, 11, 15],
  "target": 9
}
```

This JSON input represents an array of integers and a target integer that can be parsed and used as input for the `twoSum` function.
[{[2,4,3], [5,6,4]}, {[0], [0]}, {[9,9,9,9,9,9,9], [9,9,9,9]}]
To solve this problem in less than O(n^2) time complexity, we can use a hashmap to store the difference between the target and the current element as we iterate through the array. Here's the Python implementation:

```python
def twoSum(nums, target):
    hashmap = {} # create an empty hashmap

    for i in range(len(nums)):
        complement = target - nums[i] # calculate the complement needed to reach the target
        
        if complement in hashmap: # if the complement is already in the hashmap, return the indices
            return [hashmap[complement], i]
        
        hashmap[nums[i]] = i # store the current element and its index in the hashmap

# Example usage
nums = [2, 7, 11, 15]
target = 9
print(twoSum(nums, target)) # Output: [0, 1]
```

This solution has a time complexity of O(n) where n is the number of elements in the array, as we only need to iterate through the array once.
For the Python function signature:

```python
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next

def addTwoNumbers(l1: ListNode, l2: ListNode) -> ListNode:
    pass
```

You can generate input values for `l1` and `l2` as follows:

1. For Example 1:
```python
# l1 = [2,4,3]
node1 = ListNode(2)
node1.next = ListNode(4)
node1.next.next = ListNode(3)

# l2 = [5,6,4]
node2 = ListNode(5)
node2.next = ListNode(6)
node2.next.next = ListNode(4)
```

2. For Example 2:
```python
# l1 = [0]
node1 = ListNode(0)

# l2 = [0]
node2 = ListNode(0)
```

3. For Example 3:
```python
# l1 = [9,9,9,9,9,9,9]
node1 = ListNode(9)
node1.next = ListNode(9)
node1.next.next = ListNode(9)
node1.next.next.next = ListNode(9)
node1.next.next.next.next = ListNode(9)
node1.next.next.next.next.next = ListNode(9)
node1.next.next.next.next.next.next = ListNode(9)

# l2 = [9,9,9,9]
node2 = ListNode(9)
node2.next = ListNode(9)
node2.next.next = ListNode(9)
node2.next.next.next = ListNode(9)
```

For the JavaScript function signature, you can generate input values for `l1` and `l2` in a similar way.
